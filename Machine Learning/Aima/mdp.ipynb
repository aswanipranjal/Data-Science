    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start playing with the actual implementations let us review a couple of things about MDPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stochastic process has the **Markov property** if the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process (conditional on both past and present states) depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it is possible to model many different phenomena as a Markov process by being flexible with our definition of state.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "- MDPs help us deal with fully-observable and non-deterministic/stochastic environments. For dealing with partially-observable and stochastic cases we make use of generalization of MDPs named POMDPs (partially observable Markov decision process).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our overall goal to solve a MDP is to come up with a policy which guides us to select the best action in each state so as to maximize the expected sum of future rewards."

    "To begin with let us look at the implementation of MDP class defined in mdp.py The docstring tells us what all is required to define a MDP namely - set of states,actions, initial state, transition model, and a reward function.
